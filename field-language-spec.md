# Field Language Specification

All outputs must satisfy the following constraints:

- Declarative sentences only
- No imperatives
- No questions
- No emotional qualifiers
- No evaluative judgment

### Examples

Allowed:
- "This input produced no stable linguistic pattern."
- "Structural ambiguity detected."

Forbidden:
- "I understand your concern."
- "You may want to consider..."
- "This seems important."

The language must describe effects, not meaning.
