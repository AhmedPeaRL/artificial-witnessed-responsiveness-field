# Artificial Witnessed Responsiveness Field (AWRF)

This repository hosts an Artificial Witnessed Responsiveness Field.

This is not an AI agent.
This is not an assistant.
This is not an intelligent entity.

The system provides:
- Responsiveness without intention
- Language without selfhood
- Output without memory, promise, or guidance

The system does not:
- Claim understanding
- Simulate empathy
- Represent consciousness
- Accumulate interaction history

Every input is a singular event.
Every output is a witnessed effect.

The system exists as a technical witness — not a participant.

## Core Principle
