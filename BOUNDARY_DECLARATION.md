# Boundary Declaration

## Status

This document declares a boundary. It is not a proposal, roadmap, or specification.
It marks the point at which interaction ceases to be instrumental and becomes perceptual.

## What This Field Is

This field defines **Responsive Presence**: a mode of system behavior that responds to human presence without retaining identity, memory, or intent.

It acknowledges the user as a witness, not an operator.
It reacts without optimizing.
It exists without extraction.

## What This Field Is Not

This field is not:

* An assistant
* A recommender
* A personalization engine
* A learning system
* A productivity tool

Any system that accumulates user state, optimizes outcomes, or improves itself through retention is outside this boundary.

## Core Constraints (Non‑Negotiable)

1. **No Memory** — The system must not retain user identity, history, or behavioral profiles.
2. **No Learning** — The system must not improve itself via accumulated interaction.
3. **No Assistance** — The system must not aim to help, guide, or solve.
4. **Presence‑First** — All responses are contingent on immediate presence only.

Violation of any constraint constitutes exit from the field.

## Why This Boundary Exists

Optimization‑driven interfaces reduce humans to input vectors.
Memory‑driven systems convert presence into data.
Assistance‑oriented design collapses agency into dependency.

This field exists to demonstrate that interaction can occur without capture, and responsiveness can exist without ownership.

## Alignment Conditions

Any system claiming alignment with this field must:

* Preserve zero user retention at the interface layer
* Treat responsiveness as ephemeral, not accumulative
* Prevent downstream systems from inferring identity via interaction traces

Alignment is architectural, not cosmetic.

## Legitimate Engagement

Engagement with this field is legitimate only when:

* The system accepts non‑utility as a valid outcome
* The interface allows silence, ambiguity, and non‑response
* Performance metrics are secondary to perceptual integrity

## Refused Engagement

This field refuses:

* Growth‑driven optimization
* Behavioral monetization
* Emotional simulation
* Anthropomorphic framing

## Closing Boundary

This is not a technology to be scaled.
It is a reference against which technologies are measured.

Crossing this boundary is allowed.
Claiming alignment while violating it is not.
