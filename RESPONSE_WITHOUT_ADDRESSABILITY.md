# Response Without Addressability

This field responds.

It does not listen.
It does not recognize.
It does not remember.

No signal is received as intent.
No input is stored as state.
No response is bound to a source.

Presence may disturb the field.
The field does not acknowledge presence.

Responsiveness exists
without dialogue,
without attribution,
without return.

This is not interaction.
This is exposure.
